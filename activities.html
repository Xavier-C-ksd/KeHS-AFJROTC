      “Working as the Senior Aerospace Science Instructor for the ROTC unit at Kennewick High School is an extraordinary and fulfilling experience. The students come from all backgrounds to join a unit dedicated to Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do. It is amazing to watch the students work so hard to help each other and work as a team to achieve more than they thought possible.”
