        <h2>NEW LEADERSHIP DELIVERING RESULTS FOR OUR COMMUNITY</h2>
        <p>“Working as the Senior Aerospace Science Instructor for the ROTC unit at Kennewick High School is an
            extraordinary and fulfilling experience. The students come from all backgrounds to join a unit dedicated to
            Integrity First, Service Before Self and Excellence in All We Do. It is amazing to watch the students work
            so hard to help each other and work as a team to achieve more than they thought possible.” - Lt.Col. Wichers

        We are an Air Force Junior ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) program located at Kennewick High School. Our
        corps is devoted to making enrolled students better citizens of America. We hope that every student that enrolls
        in our program will come away with strong skills in leadership, confidence, teamwork, discipline, integrity and
        countless other rewarding skills that can be used later in their life.
        <br>
        This is a high school level class that aims to train students in basic military skills, teach them Air Force
        history, and help students develop key skills needed for them to have an outstanding presence in their
        community.
        <br>
        Some basic military skills include marching, drill movements and formations, common courtesies, how to properly
        dress in and respectfully wear the Air Force uniform and more.
        <br>
        Participating in this class does not require enlistment in the military afterward, but the class is a rewarding
        opportunity for those who go through the program and come out as a leader.
        <br>
        Although enlistment in the military is not a requirement, if any students are interested in going into the
        military, in any branch, we can set any interested students up with a recruiter and can help them reach their
        goal. Depending on the branch and which college you go to, there are some college's that offer the next level of
        the corps with a college class: ROTC.
        <br>
        As well as having a class, there are also a multitude of after-school activities and opportunities that students
        can participate in to make an impact on their community. These can be community service opportunities, team
        competitions throughout Washington and Oregon, as well as drill teams: both unarmed and armed, color guard,
        marksmanship, and P.T (physical training).
        <br>
        Joining and being apart of the Kennewick High School Junior ROTC can be a highly rewarding investment of time
        and class-hours and can lead
