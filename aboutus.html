    <h2>NEW LEADERSHIP DELIVERING RESULTS FOR OUR COMMUNITY</h2>
    <p class="quote">
      “Working as the Senior Aerospace Science Instructor for the ROTC unit at Kennewick High School is an extraordinary
      and fulfilling experience. The students come from all backgrounds to join a unit dedicated to Integrity First,
      Service Before Self and Excellence in All We Do. It is amazing to watch the students work so hard to help each
      other and work as a team to achieve more than they thought possible.”
      <br>— <strong>Lt.Col. Wichers</strong>

    <p>
      We are an Air Force Junior ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) program located at Kennewick High School. Our
      corps is devoted to making enrolled students better citizens of America. We hope that every student that enrolls
      in our program will come away with strong skills in leadership, confidence, teamwork, discipline, integrity and
      countless other rewarding skills that can be used later in their life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a high school level class that aims to train students in basic military skills, teach them Air Force
      history, and help students develop key skills needed for them to have an outstanding presence in their community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some basic military skills include marching, drill movements and formations, common courtesies, how to properly
      dress in and respectfully wear the Air Force uniform and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participating in this class does not require enlistment in the military afterward, but the class is a rewarding
      opportunity for those who go through the program and come out as a leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although enlistment in the military is not a requirement, if any students are interested in going into the
      military, in any branch, we can set them up with a recruiter and help them reach their goal. Depending on the
      branch and which college they attend, some schools offer the next level of the corps with a college-level ROTC
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to classroom learning, there are also many after-school activities and opportunities that students can
      participate in to make an impact on their community. These include community service projects, competitions
      throughout Washington and Oregon, and specialty teams such as <strong>drill (armed & unarmed)</strong>,
      <strong>color guard</strong>, <strong>marksmanship</strong>, and <strong>physical training (PT)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joining and being a part of the Kennewick High School Junior ROTC can be a highly rewarding investment of time and
      effort — helping students grow as leaders, citizens, and teammates.
